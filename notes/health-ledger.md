# Blockchain Health Ledger

A Validator is essentially another server/daemon node that verifying and incrementing the ledger index with specific blocks.

What is a test bed?  A test bed is like a work station?

An Offical Ripple Validator is present here at KU ITTC.

A testbed in software development is a a sandbox used for testbedding certain methods of a particular module.  Such as a function, class, or library in an isolated fashion.  It maty be used as a proof of concept or when a new module is tested apart from the program.  A good example 

Attestation and Appraisal 

Manifests configure components
- invidual components
- systems of components

Health records contain evidence
- abstraction of component state
- structed data for appraising systems

Ledger stores health records
- records from components 
- stored over time

Relying components appraise targets
- evidence from health ledger

Composing Evidence
Components request measurements
- On demand evidence from targets
- custom evidence fro relying party
- caching increases efficiency and increases complexity

Components appraise targets
- evidence from target
- evidence from ledger
- evidence from others
- baseline from manifest

Components share results
- updated health records
- new external perspective

Multi-Facetted Appraisal
Attestation Pattern

Manifests describe systems
- multiple comonent manifests allowed communication
- measurement resoonsibilities

Late launch and build that chain up to that appraiser 
Manifests are instructions to manifest those systems


The Health Ledger 
Let's show that our API's work and then move to a different chain

Multi-Facetted Appraisal
Manifests describe systems
- multiple component manifests
- allowed communication
- measurement responsibilities

Specialized Components
- attestation and appraisial compoents
- out-of-band attestation and appraisal

Heterogeneous evidence
- consumed directly
- written to the ldger
- cached fro later use

- The blockchain will give us the abaility to store data
- Swap out of the Ethereum blockchain to the XRP blockchain
