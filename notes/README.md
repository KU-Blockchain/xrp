### What is DARPA?

Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is a research and devlopment agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.  The agency was founded under Dwight D. Eisenhower in response to the Soviet lunching of Sputnik in 1957.  DARPA has formulated and exevcuted reseqarch and developemht projects to expand the frontiers of technolology and science beyond the immediate U.S. military requirements.  

The Economist has called DARPA the agency "that has shaped the modern world" and has pointed out that "Weather satellites, GPS, drones, stealth technology, voice interfaces, the personal computer, and the internet on the list of innovations for which DARPA can claim partial credit.  

### Mission Statement

For more than fifty years, DARPA has held to a singular and enduring mission: to make pivotal investments in breakthrough technologies for national security.

"To cast a javelin into the infinite spaces of the future." -- Franz Liszt


DARPA explicitly reaches for transformational change instead of incremental advances. But it does not perform its engineering alchemy in isolation. It works within an innovation ecosystem that includes academic, corporate and governmental partners, with a constant focus on the Nationâ€™s military Services, which work with DARPA to create new strategic opportunities and novel tactical options. For decades, this vibrant, interlocking ecosystem of diverse collaborators has proven to be a nurturing environment for the intense creativity that DARPA is designed to cultivate.
