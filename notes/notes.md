### Blockchain Projects
Supply chains is battlefield using a blockchain to address the battlefield

The End of History - Spencer Museum
Art project - Joey Ore is curator at the Spencer Museum (science and mathematics of art)
Simon Denny - blockchain artist from New Zealand, going to Germany
Informed on the technical side
Stephanie 
Organic artist, she only builds things from scratch
Interested in social structures
she’s the one that understands consensus
There will be a day where the artists attack history as a copy of the 
rockchalk.io
NFT recipes for ownership for things
Blockchain as a history ledger
doing a piece that reflect history that control stories and attack stories
our culture depends on social systems (i.g. political systems)
What does it mean too manipulate our social structures
Two adversaries:  Russia and China
Think of a chain as a ledger 
A chain is high integrity which is a good property 
if we treat a blockchain as a history and allow access to it na majority attack changes how the history is 
When an adversary manipulates the blockchain and replaces blocks they are manipulating history
Ethereum was attacked and someone took advantage of someone else’s code and ran off with millions of ethereum coin
2014 attack on the classic blockchain
history should be immutable
majority went on the new chain
The great merge - ethereum is decentralized on governance
there will be people that want to change proof of work vs proof of stake 
Take the Etheeum classic chain 
make a local copy of it and attack it
the symbolism is around doing something around January 6th 
make changes to the local copy of that chain, visualize that and then create an NFT of the visualization 
The installation will happen in a year
Take our deliverable and then take a local copy, have a 51% attack
manipulate consensus, by proof of stake vs proof of work consensus mechanism
what if we allowed access to the chain in limited ways
this community of users will have access, but we are going to limit access to the chain
to model privilege of society
will the inability to actually change the chain the attempts made
do the experiment and show the artists 
chain explorer and if we want to compile people we cannot just have terminal output 
get attention from larger (kestral in paloalto)
if you knew XRP then ripple will look at you and then stand up in front of ripple engineers
XRP gives you a leg up 

History of Black Writing
Partners wants a Mellon grant

Putting biodiversity on the Chain
biological storage facility and the practice of collecting their data 
make read only to get rid of centralized control of access
if you are a chinese botanist and the chinese government does want that

XRP
attestation managers
how to swap in and out different chains
if you can read and write out of the blockchain

Trust in a System
Remote antistatic
math analysis on those protocols
solar winds attack was needed to prepare and then the attack was 
to shred a lot of computers because they dont know that they’re attack
lets appraise the computer
puts computer health records on ethereum
ripple to have health record storage 
XRP ledger and how next time you go after a project
Unknown to build an XRP chain

Nathan Nicholes
tutoring system and an idea to use micropayments
how to use an existing technology on XRP

ACM on major computer scientist believe that bitcoin should be dumped in the sun
KCNIC
Test bed and a server so that we can work here
there are at least three linux boxes running ethereum
getting set up with accounts and have the 
IOT devices and visualization server
installing systems and getting them to work XRP documentation 
highest ranked ripple validator

Adam Pets will be involved 
Drew will be involved
