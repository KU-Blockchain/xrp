**Blockchain Health Ledger**

Semantic Remote Attestation Evidence Health Ledger

A repo that will outline a research project proposal for the XRP.
I2S project 

A test repo that will review over the basics of the xrp ledger.

- Find out how to use a local XRP chain
- Reading and writing to it 
- How to create NFTs on it

Semantic Remote Attestation Evidence on Chain
- health records and ledgers for evidence
-  system and local manisfests

**Project Members**
- Raj Kaura
- Morgan Bergen
- Tony Czajka

- JayHawk for the VPN get us access to the test bed and get it set up on 
- Virtual machines and there are two desktop boxes that are available.  
- XRP verifier installer running 
- Longest running bitcoin miner
- It is updating the chain and verifying things that might be added to the chain

Adam is the Research Assistence professor and does the 

The system admin 

- Local instances of the XRP ledger.

What do we need to download an XRP client.
Getting it initialized for the client
Lauren wants to do a hackathon with XRP 
### Goal
How to read and write out of the blockchain

We will be utilizing the `gh repo clone XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal` for referencing documentation on XRP

### Reference
Develop a basic understanding of the XRP Ledger's consensus mechanism.
[Documentation](https://xrpl.org/concepts.html)

### Key Concepts
**Understanding what Consensus is**

Consensus is the most important property of any decentralized payment system. In traditional centralized payment systems, one authoritative administrator gets the final say in how and when payments occur. Decentralized systems, by definition, don't have an administrator to do that. Instead, decentralized systems like the XRP Ledger define a set of rules all participants follow, so every participant can agree on the exact same series of events and their outcome at any point in time. We call this set of rules a consensus protocol.


### Questions
- What are attestation managers?
- How to swap in and out different chains?
- What language do we read and write out of the blockchain from?
- How to interact with the decentralized blockchain daemon implemented with the XRP Ledger in C++

attestation managers
how to swap in and out different chains

XRP Project


Timeline
Meet Friday's from 4 pm - 8 pm (This is the window, doesn’t have to be that long)
No concrete deadline
First steps
Find out how to use a local XRP chain, if possible
Reading and writing to it 
How to create NFTs on it
There’s a test bed for running attestation stuff
And running blockchain stuff
Don’t rely on personal equipment… use server
Getting set up: perry will talk to sysadmins and get people set up with accounts
Dive into documentation
Lot of C++ around XRP
No clean set of requirements
Want to be able to read/write to XRP, create NFTs, integrate with attestation managers. Want to be able to swap in and out different chains. Possibly also Cordano
Adam Petz involved (graduate student)
