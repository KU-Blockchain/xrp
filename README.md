# xrp

**A test repo that will review over the basics of the xrp ledger.**
- Find out how to use a local XRP chain
- Reading and writing to it 
- How to create NFTs on it
- attestation managers
- how to swap in and out different chains

> We will be utilizing the `gh repo clone XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal` for referencing documentation on XRP

### Blockchain Health Ledger

Semantic Remote Attestation Evidence Health Ledger

A repo that will outline a research project proposal for the XRP

Semantic Remote Attestation Evidence on Chain
- health records and ledgers for evidence
- system and local manisfests
- Local instances of the XRP ledger.

### Key Concepts
**Understanding what Consensus is**

Consensus is the most important property of any decentralized payment system. In traditional centralized payment systems, one authoritative administrator gets the final say in how and when payments occur. Decentralized systems, by definition, don't have an administrator to do that. Instead, decentralized systems like the XRP Ledger define a set of rules all participants follow, so every participant can agree on the exact same series of events and their outcome at any point in time. We call this set of rules a consensus protocol.
