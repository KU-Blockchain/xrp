# XRPL
XRPL (XRP Ledger) is a Distributed Ledger Technology, is a decentralized, public blockchain led by a global developer community.  The ledger is owned by Ripple Labs Inc.    

### XRP Basics

**1.  What is XRP?**

XRP is a Internationally recognized standarized asset/currency code validated and now compliant by ISO 20022 - ISO 2022 is under SWIFT known to be the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications which provides a secure messaging system for financial transactions between participating banks.  A Currency Code is a code allocated to a currency by a Maintenance Agency under an international identification scheme as described in the latest edition of the international standard ISO "Codes for the representation of currencies and funds".

**2.  What does XRP Stand for?**

> XRP is the three-letter currency/asset code formed by appending a single character to a two-letter county code of the issuing country.

**X** - Asset

**RP** - Ripple Labs

The **X** Represents assets not issued by any country, via standarizations XRP is not issued by any country, thus for assets not issued by any country, the first letter must be X.  No country codes starting with X will be issued. So, for example, since the chemical symbol for gold is Au, gold’s currency code is XAU.  XRP’s first letter is X because XRP is not issued by any country.  In the early days, we called the ledger’s native asset “ripples”. So the natural currency code to choose was “XRP”. 

**Examples**

1. USD - United States "Dollar"
    
    Since the United States’ country code is “US”, US dollars have the currency code “USD”.

2.  EUR - European Union "Euro"

    The European Union is a not a country, but still acts as a country code. The EU has the country code “EU”, so the currency code for Euros is “EUR”.

3.  XBT - Bitcoin "Asset"

    Some people use “BTC” for bitcoin, however the formalization standard of bitcoin is actually “XBT”. 

**3.  What is [ISO 20022](https://www.iso20022.org)?**

ISO2022 - Universal Financial Industry Message Scheme

ISO20022 International Organization for Standardization is a single standarization approach (methodology, process, repository) to be used by all financial standards initiatives.  It is a standard/protocol that allows for electronic data to interchange between different financial institutions. In covers financial information transferred between organizations that include credit or debit card transactions, settlement data and securities trading, and other payment transactions.  In general the payment protocols and messages across the world are validated by countries and financial networks which all adhere to various standardizations.  These standardizations are recognized by the IS) 20022 which bring legacy payment infrastructure to help global interoperabilityy and allow for world's cross-border payment flows.  RippleNet is apart of the ISO 20022 Registrtaion Management Group (RMG) standards body and the first member focused on Distributed Ledger Technology (DTL).  

**4.  What is [SWIFT](https://www.swift.com)**

Swift is the global providor of secure financial messaging services and implements cross-border payment systems such as ISO 2022

**A test repo that will review over the basics of the xrp ledger.**
- Find out how to use a local XRP chain
- Reading and writing to it 
- How to create NFTs on it
- attestation managers
- how to swap in and out different chains

> We will be utilizing the `gh repo clone XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal` for referencing documentation on XRP

### Blockchain Health Ledger

Semantic Remote Attestation Evidence Health Ledger

A repo that will outline a research project proposal for the XRP

Semantic Remote Attestation Evidence on Chain
- health records and ledgers for evidence
- system and local manisfests
- Local instances of the XRP ledger.

### Goal
How to read and write out of the blockchain

### Reference
Develop a basic understanding of the XRP Ledger's consensus mechanism.

### Key Concepts
**Understanding what Consensus is**

Consensus is the most important property of any decentralized payment system. In traditional centralized payment systems, one authoritative administrator gets the final say in how and when payments occur. Decentralized systems, by definition, don't have an administrator to do that. Instead, decentralized systems like the XRP Ledger define a set of rules all participants follow, so every participant can agree on the exact same series of events and their outcome at any point in time. We call this set of rules a consensus protocol.

There’s a test bed for running attestation stuff
Don’t rely on personal equipment… use server
Getting set up: perry will talk to sysadmins and get people set up with accounts
Dive into documentation
Want to be able to read/write to XRP, create NFTs, integrate with attestation managers. Want to be able to swap in and out different chains.
