# XRP Ledger

**Consensus**

Consensus is the most important property of any decentralized payment system. In traditional centralized payment systems, one authoritative administrator gets the final say in how and when payments occur. Decentralized systems, by definition, don't have an administrator to do that. Instead, decentralized systems like the XRP Ledger define a set of rules all participants follow, so every participant can agree on the exact same series of events and their outcome at any point in time. We call this set of rules a consensus protocol.
