The XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol is a previously developed consensus protocol powering the XRP Ledger. It is a low-latency Byzantine agreement protocol, capable of reaching consensus without full agreement on which nodes are members of the network. We present a detailed explanation of the algorithm and derive conditions for its safety and liveness.
