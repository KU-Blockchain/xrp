# xrp ledger course notes

begin coding with xrpl

- install xrpl.js library

use the token test harness HTML files to see tokens transfer between two accounts.  The xrpl is a customizable blockchain.  You can create your own interface.

- each part of this tutorial includes one JavaScript file containing functions using XRPL.js library and one html file containing form fields and buttons which interact with the JavaScript functions.

- The harness displays two accounts at once, so that you can transfer tokens from one account to the other and see the results in real time.  The image below shows the token test harness at completion of the tutorial.

## steps for ledger interaction

1. connect to the xrpl and instantiate your wallet
2. make changes to the xrpl using transactions
3. get the state of accounts and takens on the xrpl using requests.
4. disconnect from the xrpl

Each lesson will demonstrate how to build the **token test harness** one section at a time.
